## CONTRIBUTING:

1. Ensure that the code is properly spaced and does not look cramped.  
`a = b + c`     ✓  
`a=b+c`         ✗  

2. Create a separate PR for each individual issue that you address.  
Ensure that when you create a PR addressing a certain issue, you reference that issue in the comments while creating the PR.

3. Discuss what you're going to do and how you're going to handle an issue before you work on it to minimize rework.
Basically, get the requirements clear before starting to work.
