### Terms and Definitions:
- **Slice**: Take any side and join it's endpoints to the center of octagon. The triangle that you get is a slice.  
In this way, an octagon is formed of eight slices. A pentagon is formed of five slices.
- **Level**: Divide each slice with lines that are parallel to the side of octagon. And let the lines be equidistant.  
If there are 10 levels, the slice is divided into 10 parts in this way.
- **Segment**: Each level in a slice is called a segment.  
So, if there are 10 levels, there are 10 segments in each slice.

### What this project does:
This project uses Python to create an n level graded octagon in SVG.  
With proper styling and javascript, it looks like [this][1].  
You can colour and decolour the segments by clicking on them.  

### What can this be used for?
One of my friends, who is a teacher, used it to provide evaluation and feedback to his students.  
He used each slice to depict a particular parameter such as performance in tests, attentiveness in class, speaking skills, etc.
And according to the score, he colored the segments.  
You can check it out [here][2]
